The three MATLAB files are for model fitting for the one, two and three layer system - if the reader is attempting the fitting with these scripts, it may be time-efficient to email the corresponding author (j.wong20@imperial.ac.uk or other author on paper) to set up a quick call with Jasper to walk through the fitting process. 

Excel files are labelled with respect to the date of experiment operating conditions: temperature, gas concentration. Conversion data used for model fitting is in a separate sheet to the raw TGA data.
